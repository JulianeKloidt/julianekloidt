    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years, eustress—the positive experience of a challenging situation—has attracted growing attention across multiple research areas. Despite this interest, the concept remains fragmented. Different scholars have defined, measured, and manipulated eustress in inconsistent ways, making it difficult to compare findings or build a coherent body of knowledge.\nRecognizing this gap, Prof. Lawrence Barsalou and I set out to develop a unified and empirically grounded construct of eustress. Our goal was not to impose our own theoretical preferences, but to synthesize what the literature itself already suggests.\nTo do this, we reviewed 80 theoretical, empirical, interventional, and psychometric articles related to eustress. From these sources, we extracted 57 distinct features that authors had associated with eustress. We then organized and interpreted these features to create what we term the Comprehensive Hierarchical construct of Eustress (CHE).\nAccording to CHE, eustress arises from three overarching sources:\n\nSuccessful goal-directed action. This includes feelings and processes associated with competence, progress, and effective effort.\nExperiencing the moment as enjoyable, fulfilling, or meaningful. These are states in which individuals find engagement, intrinsic reward, or personal significance.\nStable individual qualities that predispose people to experience eustress. Traits such as optimism, resilience, or self-efficacy that make eustress more likely to occur.\n\nWithin each source, CHE specifies multiple facets, which together organize the full set of 57 features we identified.\n\nWe also conducted bibliometric analyses to determine which hierarchical elements of CHE have been emphasized most heavily in existing scholarship.\nTaken together, our results indicate that eustress cannot be captured by a single, narrow definition. Instead, it functions as a family resemblance structure—a cluster of statistically related states that emerge under conditions of successful goal pursuit and fulfilling momentary experience. Over time, repeatedly experiencing these states appears to help individuals develop the more trait-like capacities that promote eustress in future challenging situations. Notably, these capacities strongly overlap with well-established components of wellbeing, suggesting that wellbeing itself may support the emergence of eustress when individuals encounter demanding circumstances.\n\n\nSo what?\nThrough CHE, we aim to provide researchers with a more precise, integrative framework for studying eustress and advancing the field in a cumulative and coherent manner.\nThis matters for several reasons:\n\nClarity enables better science. A unified construct reduces confusion, allowing researchers to design more consistent studies, compare results across fields, and build theory that actually accumulates.\nInterventions can become more targeted. By identifying the specific sources and facets of eustress, CHE helps practitioners design programs that intentionally cultivate the conditions in which eustress is most likely to occur.\nIt bridges stress research and wellbeing science. CHE highlights how eustress and wellbeing feed into one another, suggesting new ways to support people in challenging environments—from workplaces to educational settings to clinical contexts.\nIt reframes challenge as opportunity. Understanding eustress not as a single feeling but as a family of positive, adaptive responses opens the door to a richer, more nuanced understanding of how people thrive under pressure.\n\n\n\nReference\nKloidt, J., & Barsalou, L.

    "title": "Establishing feature profiles of threatening and challenging situations generated with AI",
    "section": "",
    "text": "People encounter many kinds of difficult situations in daily life—from performance evaluations to interpersonal conflicts—and these situations often trigger stress responses. Yet surprisingly little research has mapped out what exactly makes a situation feel threatening or challenging, or how different situational features combine to shape these responses. Without this foundation, it is difficult to build accurate theories of stress or to design context-sensitive interventions.\nTo address this gap, Prof. Lawrence Barsalou, Monika Balaya, and I conducted a pre-registered study aimed at systematically characterizing the features of challenging situations. In the first step, we used an open-source large language model (LLM) to generate a diverse set of 20 situations that capture common stressors faced by UK adults—for example, “Give a public speech in front of a large audience.”\nNext, 81 UK adults evaluated each situation according to threat, challenge, and eight theory-derived features such as intrinsic difficulty. By aggregating their responses, we created a 10-dimensional feature profile for each situation.\n\nOur analyses revealed several notable findings:\n\nThe feature profiles were highly reliable, indicating that people agree on the core properties of these situations.\nAcross the set, situations tended to evoke low threat and moderate challenge, but with meaningful variation that allowed comparisons.\nSurprisingly, the eight situational features correlated similarly with both threat and challenge. Rather than forming two opposing patterns—as some theories might predict—they each explained substantial variance in both constructs.\nUsing unsupervised clustering, we identified four coherent groups of situations, each representing a distinct way that threat and challenge show up in everyday life.\n\n\nWe also evaluated whether an open-source LLM could generate judgments that match human evaluations. Although its average feature ratings resembled human data, its performance varied widely across situations, and importantly, it failed to reproduce the structural relationships—such as the inter-feature correlations—that we observed in human judgments.\n\n\nSo what?\nThese findings advance our understanding of situational features underlying threat and challenge, while illustrating the potential and current limitations of LLMs as tools for psychological research.\nHere’s why this matters:\n\nIt provides a foundational framework for stress research. By identifying the specific situational features that drive threat and challenge responses, this work helps refine theories that have long lacked systematic empirical grounding.\nIt enables better situational design in applied settings. Organizations, educators, clinicians, and policymakers can use these feature profiles to better understand which aspects of situations make them stressful—and how to adjust them when appropriate.\nIt moves the field toward standardization. The normed set of 20 situations offers a shared tool for future research, making it easier to compare findings across studies and build cumulative knowledge.\nIt highlights complex patterns in how threat and challenge emerge. The discovery that the eight features predict both constructs similarly challenges simple models and encourages more nuanced theorizing.\nIt clarifies what LLMs can(not) do. By showing that LLMs may match human judgments at the surface level but fail to capture deeper structure, this work sets realistic expectations for their use in psychological science.\n\nIn summary, this study offers both a detailed map of how stressful situations are structured and a methodological contribution that can guide future research at the intersection of psychology and AI.\n\n\nReference\nKloidt, J., Balaya, M., & Barsalou, L.

    "title": "Coping, fulfilment, and successful outcomes: Assessing sources of eustress across real-life challenging situations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Understanding why people experience eustress—the positive experience of a challenging situation—requires more than identifying who tends to feel it. It also requires measuring the processes that shape eustress in specific moments. Without capturing these situational dynamics, attempts to promote eustress in real-world settings (like workplaces, classrooms, or clinical environments) risk being incomplete or ineffective.\nTo address this, Prof. Lawrence Barsalou and I conducted a pre-registered study using the Situated Assessment Method, which allows us to examine how people respond to realistic, well-characterized situations. We asked 251 adults in the UK to judge how much eustress they would experience in 20 previously evaluated challenging situations (e.g., “Give a public speech in front of a large audience”). Alongside these judgments, participants rated nine key psychological processes drawn from the Comprehensive Hierarchical construct of Eustress (CHE), including coping ability, fulfilment, and successful outcomes.\nParticipants also completed trait-level measures: their typical experiences of eustress and distress, and their stress mindsets (whether they see stress as helpful or harmful).\nOur results revealed a highly nuanced picture:\n\nPeople differ reliably from one another in how much eustress they experience.\nSituations themselves matter a great deal. Some consistently elicit more eustress than others.\nIndividual × situation interactions were large, meaning that different people respond to the same situation in surprisingly different ways.\n\nThe nine psychological processes were strongly related to situational eustress: in individual-level regressions, they explained a median of 83% of the variance in eustress judgments.\n\nWhen we averaged participants’ eustress responses across situations, these individual scores correlated with trait eustress (CHER-Qual) and with a “stress-is-enhancing” mindset (SMM), but not with trait distress (PSS-10), underscoring that eustress and distress are not simply opposites.\nFinally, exploratory factor analyses at both situational and trait levels revealed a dominant general factor across the influential processes. This factor strongly tracked participants’ eustress judgments, suggesting that a shared underlying mechanism may organize how people appraise and respond to challenging situations.\n\n\nSo what?\nOur findings align with existing theories of stress, contrast different types of eustress measurement, and provide rich descriptive profiles for personalized and context-sensitive interventions to foster eustress when desirable.\nThis work has several important implications:\n\nIt brings precision to eustress measurement. By showing how situational processes drive eustress moment-by-moment, we move beyond static trait measures and toward assessments that capture real psychological dynamics.\nIt highlights individual–situation interplay. The same challenge can be motivating for one person and overwhelming for another. Understanding these patterns supports more personalized approaches to stress management.\nIt clarifies what truly predicts eustress. The nine CHE-based processes explain most of the variation in eustress experiences, offering clear targets for interventions—for example, enhancing coping resources or strengthening fulfilment.\nIt separates eustress from distress. The absence of a relationship with trait distress reinforces that eustress is not simply “low distress,” but a distinct and positive mode of engaging with challenge.\nIt guides applied practice. Whether in organizations, schools, or clinical settings, interventions can now be designed to fit both the person and the situation, making efforts to cultivate eustress more effective.\n\nIn short, this study provides a detailed and scientifically grounded map of how eustress arises in real-life challenges—and offers the tools needed to foster it intentionally and precisely.\n\n\nReference\nKloidt, J., & Barsalou, L.

    "title": "Developing and evaluating the Comprehensive Hierarchical Eustress Review (CHER)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Eustress—the positive experience of a challenging situation—has become an important topic in psychological research. Yet the field still lacks clarity on several key questions: Which features truly define eustress? How should these features be organized psychometrically? How does eustress relate to distress and wellbeing? And can individuals be meaningfully grouped into different eustress profiles?\nTo address these questions, we developed a new measurement instrument: the Comprehensive Hierarchical Eustress Review (CHER). CHER is grounded in our recently proposed Comprehensive Hierarchical construct of Eustress (CHE)—a model that identifies three major sources of eustress:\n\nGoal-directed action (progress, competence, effective effort)\nMomentary experience (enjoyment, fulfilment, meaningful engagement)\nStable individual qualities (optimism, resilience, self-efficacy)\n\nMirroring CHE, CHER contains 47 items representing the 47 literature-derived features of eustress, organized into three subscales corresponding to CHE’s sources.\nTo evaluate CHER and explore the structure of eustress, we administered it to 260 UK adults in a well-powered study. Using confirmatory factor analyses, we found that eustress is best represented by a bifactor structure—meaning it is both unidimensional (with a strong general eustress factor) and multidimensional (with meaningful subscale-specific variance). Items from all three sources contributed robustly to the central construct.\n\nThe final model displayed strong psychometric properties, including good reliability and item discrimination. In terms of external validity, eustress correlated negatively with distress and positively with wellbeing, supporting its conceptual distinctiveness and adaptive function.\nUsing latent profile analysis, we also identified four distinct eustress profiles—groups of individuals who differ in their typical experiences of goal-directed eustress, momentary eustress, and trait-like capacities. These profiles were further associated with meaningful differences in sociodemographic factors and personality traits.\n\n\nSo what?\nThis research has theoretical, empirical, and interventional implications for future work on the generation of positive experiences in challenging situations:\n\nIt offers the most comprehensive measure of eustress to date. CHER captures the full complexity of eustress—its core features, its structure, and its multiple sources—enabling more precise research and theory development.\nIt clarifies the psychometric structure of eustress. Showing that eustress is best represented by a bifactor model resolves long-standing debates about whether it is a single construct or a cluster of related ones—demonstrating that it is, in fact, both.\nIt strengthens the distinction between eustress and distress. By documenting strong links with wellbeing and inverse links with distress, CHER confirms that eustress is not merely the absence of negative stress but a genuine positive psychological state.\nIt uncovers meaningful individual differences. The four latent profiles illustrate that people differ not only in how much eustress they experience but in the specific ways they experience it—opening doors for personalized intervention.\nIt provides actionable tools for applied settings. Practitioners seeking to foster positive responses to challenge—in workplaces, schools, sports, or therapy—can use CHER profiles and subscale scores to tailor strategies to individuals’ needs.\n\n\n\nReference\nKloidt, J., & Barsalou, L.W.

    "title": "The Urban Dividend Gap - WINNER of the Data Lab Data Visualisation Competition",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I feel incredibly grateful and honoured that my entry won the Data Lab Data Visualisation Competition on Exploring Climate Action 2025! After being shortlisted from more than 90 competition entries, I had the opportunity to pitch my infographic to the Data Lab’s judging panel and received the highest scores.\nThe Urban Dividend Gap - Unmasking Inequity in Scotland’s Net Zero Transition\nWe are often told that the journey to Net Zero is a universal win for publish health and the economy. But when we look at Scottish data from the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute, we can see a different story.\nMy data visualisation presents the ‘The Urban Dividend Gap’. For our most populous cities in Scotland, the transition isn’t just a challenge but a double burden. This work targets Scottish Local Council leaders because the story this data tells is one that requires an urgent shift in hoe we fund and prioritise urban city climate action.\nTo understand this, we first look at the national scale. Figure 1 visualises the benefits and costs of the transition as a dumbbell chart: grey dots (benefits), blue bars (costs), and pink dots (benefits minus costs). By normalising all data per capita, I ensured a fair comparison between Scotland’s 32 local authorities that are rank ordered by ‘take-home benefits’ (pink dots) on the y-axis.\nWhat becomes apparent is that our cities, like Glasgow and Edinburgh, sit at the bottom of the take-home benefit rankings. What we see is that Scotland’s city residents are being asked to pay similar costs of Net Zero for the lowest per-capita rewards in the country.\n\nFigure 1. Benefits vs. Costs of Net Zero per Capita across Scottish Local Authorities\nWhy do Scottish cities benefit less from Net Zero? The data shows a Composition Gap.\nFigure 2 visualises the per capita gains from the 5 largest co-benefit factors (increased physical activity, noise reduction, improved air quality, excess cold reduction, and improved diet quality) for Scotland’s top and bottom local authorities as stacked bar charts.\nIn car-dependent commuter belts such as Angus, East Dunbartonshire, and East Renfrewshire, the potential for improvement is massive. But in our cities where public transport use is already a baseline, the health rewards for ‘new’ physical activity (dark blue cells) are smaller. This proves that for a city like Glasgow to succeed, our policy cannot rely on transport alone. Instead, we have to unlock the potential in our housing and energy sectors.\n\nFigure 2. Composition of per Capita Gains (GBP) in Top vs. Bottom Local Authorities\nSo, what does this look like on the ground? When we zoom into Glasgow’s 746 data zones, we see a fractured landscape.\nFigure 3 visualises all co-benefits from the Net Zero transition per capita for each small area in Glasgow. The rewards of the transition are pooling in affluent pockets like the West End (show as yellow zones in the top left) while the most vulnerable communities are being left in the shade (purple-coloured data zones).\n\nFigure 3. Glasgow City’s Co-Benefits per Capita across Data Zones\nI found the most damming evidence of this equity gap in the housing sector.\nFigure 4 visualises the relationship between ‘Excess Cold’ (most important co-benefit factor related to housing) and Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation Percentile (higher SIMD percentile indicate less deprived areas) as a scatterplot with superimposed line of best fit. Figure 4 clearly shows that the benefit from reducing ‘Excess Cold’ in building is positively correlated with wealth. Current retrofit pathways favour high-value, hard-to-treat historic tenements in wealthy areas such as Newlands or Kelvinside and Jordanhill. This means however that we are effectively bypassing those in the most acute fuel poverty (data zones shown on the lefthand side of the graph). This is a serious threat to a Just Transition for Net Zero.\n\nFigure 4. Excess Cold Reduction vs. Multiple Deprivation across Glasgow’s Data Zones\nHow do we fix this?\nMy analysis points to three essential shifts:\n\nReduce the Urban Burden: We need a ‘City Transition Fund’ to subsidize the complex friction of tenement retrofitting.\nEquity-First Retrofits: We must replace existing subsidies with an SIMD-weighted allocation model to ensure benefits flow to the vulnerable.\nTargeted Active Travel: We must prioritise infrastructure in our most deprived zones to maximise health dividends where safety is a barrier.\n\nThe data is clear. The transition to Net Zero could fuel inequality in Scotland: between urban and rural local authorities, and between wealthy and deprived data zones. But by acknowledging the Urban Dividend Gap, we can transform it into a truly Just Transition.\nLet’s ensure that by 2050, the wealthiest residents aren’t the only ones living in warmer homes.\nAbout the Method:\nUsing the dataset that was provided by The Data Lab, I estimated co-benefits of Scotland’s transition to Net Zero from 2025 to 2050. To ensure fair comparisons between different local authorities and small areas (data zones), I normalised the estimates per capita. I calculated local authority results by aggregating data zones. I assessed spatial inequality by joining the co-benefit data with the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD).\nReferences: I used geometries from theSpatial Hub Scotland (2025). I accessed data from the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute (2025) and the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (2020). The R code for my analyses is available at: https://github.com/JulianeKloidt/data_viz2025.\nValidation Checks:\nTo provide an indication on the robustness of my results, I performed two validation checks.\n\nDoes ‘Excess Cold’ also correlate positively with ‘Wealth’ (higher SIMD percentile) in other Scottish Cities?\nDo other co-benefit factors form the housing sector also correlate positively with ‘Wealth’ (higher SIMD percentile)?\n\nPlease check out my GitHub repository for the validation code and outputs.\nFor my first validation check, I visualised the relationship between ‘Excess Cold’ and ‘Wealth’ in Scotland’s next largest cities: Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Dundee. As for Glasgow, ‘Excess Cold’ and ‘Wealth’ are positively correlated in Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Dundee. These results prove that inequity in the Net Zero transition is not a Glasgow-only phenomenon.\nFor my second validation check, I visualised the relationship between ‘Dampness’ (the second biggest co-benefit factor related to housing) and ‘Wealth’ in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Dundee. I found no relationship between both variables in Glasgow as well as small negative correlations for the other cities. These results indicate that, when it comes to dampness reduction, more deprived data zones benefit more from Net Zero than less deprived neighbourhoods. The magnitude of benefits however is about 10 times smaller for ‘Dampness” than for ‘Excess Cold’, meaning that the inequality in the housing sector remains highly relevant.\nFeedback from the Judges:\nI received lots of constructive feedback on my data visualisation from the Data Lab Judging Panel. Although I won the first prize in the competition, there’s still room for improvement: The most prevalent feedback was that the Figure 1 (dumbbell chart) may be difficult to understand and interpret for non-experts. If I were to start this project again, I would therefore opt for a more intuitive chart, perhaps three bar charts presenting the benefits, costs, and take-home benefits, and highlighting the bars for Glasgow and Edinburgh."
