### About me

I am a PhD candidate at the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Socially Intelligent Artificial Agents](https://socialcdt.org/students/cohort-3-2021-2025/), based at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/pgrs/julianekloidt/). My PhD project on “Thriving under challenges – establishing individual and situational influences on eustress” is supervised by [Prof. Lawrence Barsalou](https://barsaloulab.org/lab-members/lawrence-barsalou/).

While pursuing my doctoral research, I have gained additional professional experiences:

I work as an independent contractor with [Dr. Sandra Geiger](https://psych.princeton.edu/people/sandra-geiger), at [Princeton University](https://elke-u-weber.com/en/elke-u-weber/labs-and-centers/bspl/) on forecasting the effectiveness of social norm interventions on the support of climate change policies with large language models.

I also work as a research assistant with [Prof. Tim Kaiser](https://sites.google.com/view/timkaiser/home?authuser=0) at the [University of Kaiserslautern-Landau (RPTU)](https://ksw.rptu.de/en/div/business-and-economics/team/professors/prof-dr-tim-kaiser) on establishing effects of behaviour change interventions (health, sustainability, and household finance), synthesising effects of capital vs training interventions on business outcomes, and investigating time preferences.

I enjoyed teaching research methods, coding in R, and psychology classes, for the [School of Psychology and Neuroscience (University of Glasgow)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/pgrs/julianekloidt/), for instance at the Widening Participation Summer School.
