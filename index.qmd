### About me

I am a PhD candidate at the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Socially Intelligent Artificial Agents](https://socialcdt.org/students/cohort-3-2021-2025/), based at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/pgrs/julianekloidt/). My PhD project on “Thriving under challenges - how personal characteristics and situational context shape positive stress and behaviour change” is supervised by [Prof. Lawrence Barsalou](https://barsaloulab.org/lab-members/lawrence-barsalou/).

I also work as a research assistant with [Prof. Tim Kaiser](https://sites.google.com/view/timkaiser/home?authuser=0) at the [University of Kaiserslautern-Landau (RPTU)](https://ksw.rptu.de/en/div/business-and-economics/team/professors/prof-dr-tim-kaiser) on establishing effects of behaviour change interventions (health, sustainability, and household finance), synthesising effects of capital vs training interventions on business outcomes, and investigating time preferences.

I enjoy teaching research methods, coding in R, and psychology classes, for the [School of Psychology and Neuroscience (University of Glasgow)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychologyneuroscience/staff/julianekloidt/), for instance at the Widening Participation Summer School.
