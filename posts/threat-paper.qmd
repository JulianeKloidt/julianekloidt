People encounter many kinds of difficult situations in daily life—from performance evaluations to interpersonal conflicts—and these situations often trigger stress responses. Yet surprisingly little research has mapped out **what exactly makes a situation feel threatening or challenging**, or how different situational features combine to shape these responses. Without this foundation, it is difficult to build accurate theories of stress or to design context-sensitive interventions.

To address this gap, [Prof. Lawrence Barsalou](https://barsaloulab.org/lab-members/lawrence-barsalou/), Monika Balaya, and I conducted a **pre-registered study** aimed at systematically **characterizing the features of challenging situations**. In the first step, we used an **open-source large language model (LLM)** to generate a diverse set of **20 situations** that capture common stressors faced by UK adults—for example, “Give a public speech in front of a large audience.”

Next, **81 UK adults** evaluated each situation according to threat, challenge, and eight theory-derived features such as intrinsic difficulty. By aggregating their responses, we created a **10-dimensional feature profile for each situation**.

Our analyses revealed several notable findings:

-   **The feature profiles were highly reliable**, indicating that people agree on the core properties of these situations.

-   Across the set, situations tended to evoke **low threat and moderate challenge**, but with meaningful variation that allowed comparisons.

-   Surprisingly, the **eight situational features correlated similarly** with both threat and challenge. Rather than forming two opposing patterns—as some theories might predict—they each explained substantial variance in both constructs.

-   Using **unsupervised clustering**, we identified four coherent groups of situations, each representing a distinct way that threat and challenge show up in everyday life.

We also evaluated whether an open-source LLM could generate judgments that match human evaluations. Although its average feature ratings resembled human data, its performance varied widely across situations, and importantly, it **failed to reproduce the structural relationships**—such as the inter-feature correlations—that we observed in human judgments.

#### So what?

These findings advance our understanding of situational features underlying threat and challenge, while illustrating the potential and current limitations of LLMs as tools for psychological research.

Here’s why this matters:

-   **It provides a foundational framework for stress research.** By identifying the specific situational features that drive threat and challenge responses, this work helps refine theories that have long lacked systematic empirical grounding.

-   **It enables better situational design in applied settings.** Organizations, educators, clinicians, and policymakers can use these feature profiles to better understand which aspects of situations make them stressful—and how to adjust them when appropriate.

-   **It moves the field toward standardization.** The normed set of 20 situations offers a shared tool for future research, making it easier to compare findings across studies and build cumulative knowledge.

-   **It highlights complex patterns in how threat and challenge emerge.** The discovery that the eight features predict both constructs similarly challenges simple models and encourages more nuanced theorizing.

-   **It clarifies what LLMs can(not) do.** By showing that LLMs may match human judgments at the surface level but fail to capture deeper structure, this work sets realistic expectations for their use in psychological science.

In summary, this study offers both a detailed map of how stressful situations are structured and a methodological contribution that can guide future research at the intersection of psychology and AI.
