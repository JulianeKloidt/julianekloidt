My PhD project on “Thriving under challenges - how personal characteristics and situational context shape positive stress and behaviour change” is supervised by Prof. Lawrence Barsalou.\nI also work as a research assistant with Prof. Tim Kaiser at the University of Kaiserslautern-Landau (RPTU) on establishing effects of behaviour change interventions (health, sustainability, and household finance), synthesising effects of capital vs training interventions on business outcomes, and investigating time preferences.\nI enjoy teaching research methods, coding in R, and psychology classes, for the School of Psychology and Neuroscience (University of Glasgow), for instance at the Widening Participation Summer School.\n\n\nResearch Interests\nHealth behaviour change | Positive stress & well-being | Data science | Generative AI\n\n\nTechnical Skills\nCoding: R (tidyverse, ggplot2, lavaan, psych, lme4) | Python (numpy, sklearn, scipy)\nWorkflows: GitHub | Jupyter | OSF\nGenerative AI: Huggingface | OpenAI API"
