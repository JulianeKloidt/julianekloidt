    "title": "What shapes our positive experiences of challenging situations?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I presented one of my PhD projects, supervised by Prof. Lawrence Barsalou, titled “Developing and validating the Comprehensive Hierarchical Eustress Review (CHER)” at the 20th Annual Scientific Meeting of the UK Society for Behavioural Medicine in Bristol. Here’s the summary of my talk:\n\nBackground:\nEustress is defined as the positive experience of a challenging situation. But what exactly makes facing challenging situations a good experience? Whereas we know a lot about what makes us experience stress negatively (and the consequences thereof), research on eustress is still in its infancy.\n\n\nResearch Questions:\nWith this project, we therefore tried to answer three research questions:\n\nWhat features of eustress are central to experiencing challenging situations positively? What psychometric structure best fits these features?\nHow is eustress related to distress (what we commonly refer to as stress) and psychological wellbeing?\nDo groups of individuals share similar eustress profiles?\n\n\n\nMethods:\nTo do so, we developed a novel eustress instrument: the Comprehensive Hierarchical Eustress Review (CHER). CHER is based on a novel eustress theory called the Comprehensive Hierarchical construct of Eustress (CHE aka my first PhD paper!). Reflecting the content and structure of the theoretical model, our novel eustress instrument included 47 items across 3 subscales: (1) goal-directed action (e.g., “When achieving personal goals in challenging situations, how much do you benefit from feeling productive?”), (2) momentary experience (e.g., “When experiencing challenging situations, how much do you find yourself flourishing and thriving in the moment?”), and (3) stable qualities (e.g., “When you think about yourself across the challenging situations in your life, how resilient are you?”). We evaluated CHER in a well-powered UK-adult sample (N = 260; 128 men; mean age = 44.60 years) using confirmatory factor analyses, validity tests, Spearman correlations, and latent profile analysis.\n\n\nRQ1: Psychometric structure of eustress\nTo assess the psychometric structure of eustress, we conducted a series of confirmatory factor analyses: (1) single-factor model, (2) three correlated-factors model reflecting the subscales of CHER, and (3) bifactor model combining the previous models. If you’re like me and you are a bit confused by all these models, perhaps you find it useful to think about them in terms of intelligence. Model 1 proposes that there is a general intelligence (IQ). Model 2 proposes that general intelligence is not really a thing and we should instead measure intelligence across different areas (e.g., emotional intelligence, musical intelligence, mathematical intelligence…). Model 3 offers a compromise proposing that, yes, there is such thing as general intelligence but people also differ meaningfully across domain-specific types of intelligence.\nFor each model, we also tested whether we really need all 47 items of the instrument to measure eustress (after all 47 questions is quite a lot). Perhaps some items are less relevant or even unrelated to eustress? We therefore removed all items with a main factor loading &lt; |.50| one item at a time. In other words, we only kept items for which the factor explained at least 25%. We then selected the best-performing model that offered reasonable model fit and conceptual interpretability.\nThe best performing model was the bifactor model keeping 35 out of 47 items. The bifactor model explained 52.17% of total variance and had acceptable model fit, CFI = .881, TLI = .865, RMSEA (90% CI) = .069 (.064 - .075). This suggests that eustress, as measured with the CHER instrument, is best explained by a general factor and three specific factors (~ subscales).\nTo get an idea of the features that are central to eustress, we visualised the pairwise Spearman correlations between all items of CHER. The figure below shows the resulting network plot. Nodes depict CHER’s items whereas edges show pairwise Spearman correlations &gt; .30 (all correlations were positive). Grey nodes show excluded items. Coloured nodes depict CHER’s subscales with the dark-blue pointing out that all these items also loaded onto a general factor.\n\nWhile being being pretty, this plot also suggests that items from the same subscale cluster together (supporting the structure of the questionnaire) and that the core of eustress (the center of the plot) contains items from all three subscales. This suggests that, in order to measure eustress comprehensively, we need to capture it as a goal-directed action, momentary experience, AND stable quality. Of the few existing eustress measures, most items focus on successful goal pursuit only…\n\n\nRQ2: How is eustress related to distress and to psychological wellbeing?\nTo find out how eustress relates to distress and wellbeing, we computed Spearman correlations between participants’ factors scores on the general eustress factor from the bifactor model, the Perceived Stress Scale (distress; Cohen et al., 1983), and the European Social Survey Module on Wellbeing (ESS Wellbeing; Huppert & So, 2013).\nInterestingly, eustress correlated most strongly with psychological wellbeing (r = .62, p &lt; .005), indicating that individuals’ positive experiences in challenging situations may be similar to their positive experience in non-challenging situations. The negative correlation between general eustress and the PSS was moderate (r = -.50, p &lt; .005) highlighting that distress and eustress are related but not exact opposites of another. Otherwise, the correlation would have been closer to -1.\n\n\nRQ3: Identifying individuals with distinct eustress profiles\n\n\n\nSo what?\nThe Comprehensive Hierarchical Eustress Review (CHER) is the first psychometric instrument to comprehensively assess positive experiences across challenging situations in a general UK adult population. Establishing the psychometric structure of eustress strongly supports its theorized sources: goal-directed action, momentary experience, and stable qualities. Further research may establish whether promoting eustress causally increases wellbeing and causally decreases distress. Identifying clusters of individuals with distinct eustress profiles can support developing tailored policy interventions for thriving under challenges.\nWant to know more? Slides | LinkedIn post"

    "text": "In recent years, eustress—the positive experience of a challenging situation—has attracted growing attention across multiple research areas. Despite this interest, the concept remains fragmented. Different scholars have defined, measured, and manipulated eustress in inconsistent ways, making it difficult to compare findings or build a coherent body of knowledge.\nRecognizing this gap, Prof. Lawrence Barsalou and I set out to develop a unified and empirically grounded construct of eustress. Our goal was not to impose our own theoretical preferences, but to synthesize what the literature itself already suggests.\nTo do this, we reviewed 80 theoretical, empirical, interventional, and psychometric articles related to eustress. From these sources, we extracted 57 distinct features that authors had associated with eustress. We then organized and interpreted these features to create what we term the Comprehensive Hierarchical construct of Eustress (CHE).\nAccording to CHE, eustress arises from three overarching sources:\n\nSuccessful goal-directed action. This includes feelings and processes associated with competence, progress, and effective effort.\nExperiencing the moment as enjoyable, fulfilling, or meaningful. These are states in which individuals find engagement, intrinsic reward, or personal significance.\nStable individual qualities that predispose people to experience eustress. Traits such as optimism, resilience, or self-efficacy that make eustress more likely to occur.\n\nWithin each source, CHE specifies multiple facets, which together organize the full set of 57 features we identified.\n\nWe also conducted bibliometric analyses to determine which hierarchical elements of CHE have been emphasized most heavily in existing scholarship.\nTaken together, our results indicate that eustress cannot be captured by a single, narrow definition. Instead, it functions as a family resemblance structure—a cluster of statistically related states that emerge under conditions of successful goal pursuit and fulfilling momentary experience. Over time, repeatedly experiencing these states appears to help individuals develop the more trait-like capacities that promote eustress in future challenging situations. Notably, these capacities strongly overlap with well-established components of wellbeing, suggesting that wellbeing itself may support the emergence of eustress when individuals encounter demanding circumstances.\n\n\nSo what?\nThrough CHE, we aim to provide researchers with a more precise, integrative framework for studying eustress and advancing the field in a cumulative and coherent manner.\nThis matters for several reasons:\n\nClarity enables better science. A unified construct reduces confusion, allowing researchers to design more consistent studies, compare results across fields, and build theory that actually accumulates.\nInterventions can become more targeted. By identifying the specific sources and facets of eustress, CHE helps practitioners design programs that intentionally cultivate the conditions in which eustress is most likely to occur.\nIt bridges stress research and wellbeing science. CHE highlights how eustress and wellbeing feed into one another, suggesting new ways to support people in challenging environments—from workplaces to educational settings to clinical contexts.\nIt reframes challenge as opportunity. Understanding eustress not as a single feeling but as a family of positive, adaptive responses opens the door to a richer, more nuanced understanding of how people thrive under pressure.\n\n\n\nReference\nKloidt, J., & Barsalou, L.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Understanding why people experience eustress—the positive experience of a challenging situation—requires more than identifying who tends to feel it. It also requires measuring the processes that shape eustress in specific moments. Without capturing these situational dynamics, attempts to promote eustress in real-world settings (like workplaces, classrooms, or clinical environments) risk being incomplete or ineffective.\nTo address this, Prof. Lawrence Barsalou and I conducted a pre-registered study using the Situated Assessment Method, which allows us to examine how people respond to realistic, well-characterized situations. We asked 251 adults in the UK to judge how much eustress they would experience in 20 previously evaluated challenging situations (e.g., “Give a public speech in front of a large audience”). Alongside these judgments, participants rated nine key psychological processes drawn from the Comprehensive Hierarchical construct of Eustress (CHE), including coping ability, fulfilment, and successful outcomes.\nParticipants also completed trait-level measures: their typical experiences of eustress and distress, and their stress mindsets (whether they see stress as helpful or harmful).\nOur results revealed a highly nuanced picture:\n\nPeople differ reliably from one another in how much eustress they experience.\nSituations themselves matter a great deal. Some consistently elicit more eustress than others.\nIndividual × situation interactions were large, meaning that different people respond to the same situation in surprisingly different ways.\n\nThe nine psychological processes were strongly related to situational eustress: in individual-level regressions, they explained a median of 83% of the variance in eustress judgments.\n\nWhen we averaged participants’ eustress responses across situations, these individual scores correlated with trait eustress (CHER-Qual) and with a “stress-is-enhancing” mindset (SMM), but not with trait distress (PSS-10), underscoring that eustress and distress are not simply opposites.\n\nFinally, exploratory factor analyses at both situational and trait levels revealed a dominant general factor across the influential processes. This factor strongly tracked participants’ eustress judgments, suggesting that a shared underlying mechanism may organize how people appraise and respond to challenging situations.\n\n\nSo what?\nOur findings align with existing theories of stress, contrast different types of eustress measurement, and provide rich descriptive profiles for personalized and context-sensitive interventions to foster eustress when desirable.\nThis work has several important implications:\n\nIt brings precision to eustress measurement. By showing how situational processes drive eustress moment-by-moment, we move beyond static trait measures and toward assessments that capture real psychological dynamics.\nIt highlights individual–situation interplay. The same challenge can be motivating for one person and overwhelming for another. Understanding these patterns supports more personalized approaches to stress management.\nIt clarifies what truly predicts eustress. The nine CHE-based processes explain most of the variation in eustress experiences, offering clear targets for interventions—for example, enhancing coping resources or strengthening fulfilment.\nIt separates eustress from distress. The absence of a relationship with trait distress reinforces that eustress is not simply “low distress,” but a distinct and positive mode of engaging with challenge.\nIt guides applied practice. Whether in organizations, schools, or clinical settings, interventions can now be designed to fit both the person and the situation, making efforts to cultivate eustress more effective.\n\nIn short, this study provides a detailed and scientifically grounded map of how eustress arises in real-life challenges—and offers the tools needed to foster it intentionally and precisely.\n\n\nReference\nKloidt, J., & Barsalou, L.

    "section": "",
    "text": "People encounter many kinds of difficult situations in daily life—from performance evaluations to interpersonal conflicts—and these situations often trigger stress responses. Yet surprisingly little research has mapped out what exactly makes a situation feel threatening or challenging, or how different situational features combine to shape these responses. Without this foundation, it is difficult to build accurate theories of stress or to design context-sensitive interventions.\nTo address this gap, Prof. Lawrence Barsalou, Monika Balaya, and I conducted a pre-registered study aimed at systematically characterizing the features of challenging situations. In the first step, we used an open-source large language model (LLM) to generate a diverse set of 20 situations that capture common stressors faced by UK adults—for example, “Give a public speech in front of a large audience.”\nNext, 81 UK adults evaluated each situation according to threat, challenge, and eight theory-derived features such as intrinsic difficulty. By aggregating their responses, we created a 10-dimensional feature profile for each situation.\nOur analyses revealed several notable findings:\n\nThe feature profiles were highly reliable, indicating that people agree on the core properties of these situations.\nAcross the set, situations tended to evoke low threat and moderate challenge, but with meaningful variation that allowed comparisons.\nSurprisingly, the eight situational features correlated similarly with both threat and challenge. Rather than forming two opposing patterns—as some theories might predict—they each explained substantial variance in both constructs.\nUsing unsupervised clustering, we identified four coherent groups of situations, each representing a distinct way that threat and challenge show up in everyday life.\n\nWe also evaluated whether an open-source LLM could generate judgments that match human evaluations. Although its average feature ratings resembled human data, its performance varied widely across situations, and importantly, it failed to reproduce the structural relationships—such as the inter-feature correlations—that we observed in human judgments.\nTogether, these findings offer a structured map of the features that underlie threat and challenge in daily life, while also showing the promise and current shortcomings of LLMs as tools for psychological research.\n\nSo what?\nThese findings advance our understanding of situational features underlying threat and challenge, while illustrating the potential and current limitations of LLMs as tools for psychological research.\nHere’s why this matters:\n\nIt provides a foundational framework for stress research. By identifying the specific situational features that drive threat and challenge responses, this work helps refine theories that have long lacked systematic empirical grounding.\nIt enables better situational design in applied settings. Organizations, educators, clinicians, and policymakers can use these feature profiles to better understand which aspects of situations make them stressful—and how to adjust them when appropriate.\nIt moves the field toward standardization. The normed set of 20 situations offers a shared tool for future research, making it easier to compare findings across studies and build cumulative knowledge.\nIt highlights complex patterns in how threat and challenge emerge. The discovery that the eight features predict both constructs similarly challenges simple models and encourages more nuanced theorizing.\nIt clarifies what LLMs can(not) do. By showing that LLMs may match human judgments at the surface level but fail to capture deeper structure, this work sets realistic expectations for their use in psychological science.\n\nIn summary, this study offers both a detailed map of how stressful situations are structured and a methodological contribution that can guide future research at the intersection of psychology and AI.\n\n\nReference\nKloidt, J., Balaya, M., & Barsalou, L.
